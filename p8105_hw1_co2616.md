loading the early_january_weather dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

``` r
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather data set has 15 variables. The variable names
are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour.
Temperature and dewpoint is meausre in F. Wind direction is measure in
degrees and speed and and gust speed are measure in mph. Precipitation
is measure in inches. Pressure is measure in millibars. Visibility is
measure in miles.

This size of the dataset is 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature of the dataset is 39.5821229

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_co2616_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("/Users/chelsopp/Documents/MPH/Data Science I/p8105_hw1_co2616/temp vs time scatterplot.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Looking at the scatterplot, temperature seems to increase as time
increases. Also, humidity seems to increase as temperature and time
increases.

# Problem 2

creating a data frame…

``` r
problem2_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(10),
    vec_log = x > 0,
    vec_charc = c("Austin", "Seattle", "Richmond",  "Charlotte", "Nashville", "Chicago", "Miami", "Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Detroit"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "low", "high", "medium", "low", "medium", "high", "medium", "low", "high"))
  )
```

taking the mean of each variable in my data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.5737605

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_charc))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_charc)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I was able to get the mean of my variables x and vec_log. The mean of
variable x was -0.04 and the mean of variable vec_log was 0.6. However,
I was not able to get the mean of my variables vec_charc and vec_factor
because these variables are not numeric/logical.

converting some of my variables…

    ## Warning in eval_tidy(xs[[j]], mask): NAs introduced by coercion

When I try to run the code above, I get an error message stating: NAs
introduced by coercion. This message results because R is trying to
convert a character or non-numeric string factor into a number, but R is
not able to do this. This confirms why I am not able to get the mean of
my variables vec_charc and vec_factor because these variables are not
numeric/logical.
