loading the early_january_weather dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

``` r
help("early_january_weather")
```

The early_january_weather data set has 15 variables. The variable names
are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour.
Temperature and dewpoint is meausre in F. Wind direction is measure in
degrees and speed and and gust speed are measure in mph. Precipitation
is measure in inches. Pressure is measure in millibars. Visibility is
measure in miles.

This size of the dataset is 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature of the dataset is 39.5821229

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("/Users/chelsopp/Documents/MPH/Data Science I/p8105_hw1_co2616/temp vs time scatterplot.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Looking at the scatterplot, temperature seems to increase as time
increases. Also, humidity seems to increase as temperature and time
increases.
